# 📐 Problem 1 - Equation of the line and angle with the horizontal axis

This Java program solves a classic analytic geometry problem: **given a line defined by two points, obtain its equation in the form `y = mx + b` and the angle it makes with the horizontal axis**.

## 📋 Problem description.

Given two points in the Cartesian plane, A(x₁, y₁) and B(x₂, y₂), program:

1. computes the **slope** of the line.
2. Determine the **equation of the line**.
3. Calculate the **angle** that the line forms with the horizontal axis in degrees.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Compiler or IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse or VS Code

## 🚀 Execution

Compile and run the ``Uno.java` file with the following commands:

```bash
javac Uno.java
java Uno
💡 Example of use
