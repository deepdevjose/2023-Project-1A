## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to solve a series of mathematical and logical problems using the knowledge acquired in the **Discrete Mathematics** and **Differential Calculus** courses during the first semester of the ICT Engineering program.

Each problem was addressed using the **6D methodology**:

> **Describe – Define – Design – Develop – Debug – Document**
