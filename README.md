Degree: Information and Communication Technologies Engineering (TICs)  
Semester: 1st  
Date: November 2023  

### üìò **Project Description**
This project is a software solution developed to address six foundational engineering problems using concepts from **Discrete Mathematics** and **Differential Calculus**. Each module solves a specific mathematical or logical problem and demonstrates the practical application of knowledge acquired during the first semester.

The development followed the **6D methodology**:
1. Problem Description  
2. Problem Definition  
3. Solution Design  
4. Solution Development  
5. Debugging and Testing  
6. Documentation  

### üß† **Topics Covered**
- Line equation and angle calculation from coordinates  
- Solving quadratic equations  
- Point-in-circle detection  
- Decimal to binary conversion (including two's complement)  
- Binary to decimal conversion  
- Boolean expression generation from truth tables  

### üíª **Technologies Used**
- Language: Java  
- IDE: [your IDE, e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, VS Code]  
- Input/Output: Console-based
